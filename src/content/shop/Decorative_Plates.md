With a charming 11-inch diameter, these plates scream festive and bright. I love the attention to detail in the handmade aspect, which makes each plate feel unique. 

The 4 assorted designs add a fun and diverse touch to your tableware. The melamine material ensures durability, so you don't have to worry about any mishaps. 

However, the only downside I noticed was that they're not dishwasher-safe, which isn't a deal breaker but worth mentioning. Overall, they've definitely brightened up my kitchen this holiday season! .

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=best.serp.co&amp;utm_content=decorative-plates&amp;utm_term=elegant-floral-salad-plates-for-everyday-dining-and-special-occasions"><img alt="btat-porcelain-floral-plates-8-inch-set-of-6-royal-dessert-plates-appetizer-plates-floral-plates-sal-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/btat-porcelain-floral-plates-8-inch-set-of-6-royal-dessert-plates-appetizer-plates-floral-plates-sal-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

When I first unboxed these BTaT Porcelain Floral Plates, I couldn't help but admire the intricate floral designs that adorned each one. The soft pastel backgrounds served as the perfect canvas for these vibrant, hand-painted blooms. I was excited to start using them in my daily life, not just for their beauty, but also for their functionality. 

One of the first things I noticed was how well they held up to daily use. The precision craftsmanship and smooth finish ensured that they remained as beautiful as the day I first set eyes on them. I appreciated the vintage charm added by the scalloped edges, which made each plate feel like a unique work of art. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks. While the plates were durable, they were rather delicate, which meant that they needed to be handled with care. Additionally, the floral patterns on some of the plates were a bit uneven, which took away from their overall appeal. 

Despite these small issues, I found the BTaT Porcelain Floral Plates to be a lovely addition to my dining set. Not only did they serve as functional dinnerware, but they also brought a touch of botanical beauty to my table. These plates would make a great addition to any home, adding a touch of charm and elegance to any dining setting. 


### [ðŸ”—Warm, Festive "Pass It On" Giving Plate by Kathy Primitive](https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=best.serp.co&utm_content=decorative-plates&utm_term=warm-festive-pass-it-on-giving-plate-by-kathy-primitive)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=best.serp.co&amp;utm_content=decorative-plates&amp;utm_term=warm-festive-pass-it-on-giving-plate-by-kathy-primitive"><img alt="primitives-by-kathy-12-inches-diameter-stoneware-giving-pass-it-on-decorative-plates-1" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/primitives-by-kathy-12-inches-diameter-stoneware-giving-pass-it-on-decorative-plates-1/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

I've had the pleasure of using this 12-inch stoneware giving plate during the holiday season, and let me tell you, it has truly been a lovely addition to our festive decor. Its weathered "Love - Pass It On" sentiment, accompanied by an enchanting snowy truck and trees design, adds a touch of warmth and nostalgia to any gathering. 

The border phrase, "This plate has no owner - Its journey never ends - It travels in a circle of our family and friends, " is a perfect representation of the heartwarming tradition that this plate carries. The combination of these inspiring sentiments and the gorgeous design on this plate makes it a standout piece in any collection. 

While I deeply appreciate the exquisite attention to detail on this giving plate, I do find its size to be a bit on the smaller side. It may not be the most practical choice for holding a large amount of cookies or snacks, but its design more than makes up for its size limitation. 

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend this stunning stoneware plate to anyone looking to spread holiday cheer and add a touch of rustic charm to their celebrations.

During a family gathering, I couldn't help but notice the stunning plate I was serving my favorite appetizers on. This reactive glaze stoneware platter, part of the Saffron & Ginger collection by Creative Co-op, added a touch of elegance to the gathering. 

Its unique abstract design, coupled with the reactive glaze finish, made every plate look distinct and one-of-a-kind. The dimensions of the platter, 13.25"L x 8.5"W x 1.5"H, allowed it to be both functional and visually appealing on my kitchen shelf when not in use. 

The only thing that could have made it better was if it were locally made instead of in China. Overall, it's a gorgeous addition to my collection and a wonderful conversation starter at family gatherings. 


### [ðŸ”—Classic Elegant Decorative Charger Plates](https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=best.serp.co&utm_content=decorative-plates&utm_term=classic-elegant-decorative-charger-plates)

<div class="image"><a href="https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&amp;utm_medium=website&amp;utm_campaign=best.serp.co&amp;utm_content=decorative-plates&amp;utm_term=classic-elegant-decorative-charger-plates"><img alt="scalloped-ruffled-charger-plates-set-of-5" src="https://imagedelivery.net/vy2bglCGN6hEeWOnSe2c7A/scalloped-ruffled-charger-plates-set-of-5/w=720,h=540,fit=pad,background=black"/></a></div>

As a proud owner of a dining table that always deserves the best presentation, I was thrilled to give these Scalloped Ruffled Charger Plates a try. The set of four, each measuring 13 inches wide and 13 inches long, perfectly complements my elegant dinnerware and adds a graceful touch to any meal. 

However, before I even got to the table, I noticed a slight challenge - removing the pesky stickers on the back without damaging the finish. After some careful and patient work, I finally managed to get rid of them, and the plates looked as stunning as I had envisioned. 

The ivory finish of the chargers, along with their antiqued scalloped trim, creates a charming, classical design that adds an elegant touch to any dining table setting. For those looking to complete a modern farmhouse or French country aesthetic, these chargers are a perfect addition to your collection. 

One thing to note is that these chargers are for decorative use only and are not safe for food, dishwashers, microwaves, or ovens. Despite this minor concern, I've found that cleaning them with a soft cloth is enough to maintain their charm and keep them in tip-top shape. 

Overall, I wholeheartedly recommend these Scalloped Ruffled Charger Plates for anyone looking to elevate their dining table dÃ©cor. The lovely design, coupled with their practical use, makes these plates a must-have for any stylish home.

When it comes to durability, I can confidently say that these plates have withstood my daily routine, including the dish washer and the microwave without any issues. However, there's one downside I've noticed - sometimes these plates can get very warm in the microwave. 

Overall, I love the timeless appeal and versatility of these plates, making them a perfect addition to any tabletop. 


### [ðŸ”—Moroccan Handmade Ceramic Serving Plates](https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=best.serp.co&utm_content=decorative-plates&utm_term=moroccan-handmade-ceramic-serving-plates)

The vibrant colors and intricate designs not only serve as a conversation starter but also add a touch of elegance to any meal. 

But what stands out the most is their versatility. When not in use, the plates can be hung on the wall like a piece of art. And for those special occasions, they're great for entertaining guests and showcasing your culinary skills. 

Of course, no artisanal piece is perfect, and the plates come with a few small imperfections. But that's part of their charm - reminders of the human touch behind each creation. 

Overall, these Moroccan handmade plates are a must-have for any kitchen or dining area. Their unique blend of style and practicality makes them a true treasure. 


### [ðŸ”—Decorative Charger Plates Set - MAONAME Gold Collection](https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=best.serp.co&utm_content=decorative-plates&utm_term=decorative-charger-plates-set--maoname-gold-collection)

The gold finish of these chargers is stunning, and they definitely elevate any dinner table or event setting. But the practicality of these plates doesn't stop there â€“ they're super easy to clean, just a quick rinse under hot water and they're as good as new. 

One thing to note, though, is that these chargers are not dishwasher-safe or microwave-friendly. You'll also want to be careful when cleaning, as using harsh detergents or steel wool can scratch the surface. Overall, though, these MAONAME Gold Charger Plates are a fantastic addition to any table setting, and their durability makes them a great investment. 


### [ðŸ”—Stylish Fish-Shaped Decorative Plate](https://serp.ly/amazon/decorative-plates?utm_source=serp.co&utm_medium=website&utm_campaign=best.serp.co&utm_content=decorative-plates&utm_term=stylish-fish-shaped-decorative-plate)

I recently had the opportunity to use this exquisite Red Stoneware Fish Shaped Plate with Wax Relief Illustration in my daily dining routine. The plate's 12.5-inch size made it perfect for serving a hearty meal at my dinner parties, while the 5.25-inch width ensured that it fit perfectly in my dishwasher for easy cleanup. The stoneware it was made of gave it a refined, cottage-inspired look that was reminiscent of a cozy country getaway. 

One delightful aspect of the plate was its food-safe nature, allowing me to confidently serve my favorite dishes on it without worrying about any compromised quality. The fact that it had the added convenience of being dishwasher safe meant that I could easily maintain the plate's pristine appearance. 

In terms of the plate's design, the wax relief illustration of a fish silhouette added a whimsical touch that was both visually appealing and conversation-worthy at my dinner parties. Despite the beauty of the plate, it was a slight source of frustration that, from a practical standpoint, it would have been more useful if it had been slightly larger - perhaps providing a larger surface area for serving. 

Overall, this Red Stoneware Fish Shaped Plate delivered in terms of its style and the dining experience it provided. It was undeniably charming and added an element of whimsy to my meals. The practical drawback of its size didn't detract much from the overall experience, making it a lovely addition to my collection of decorative plates.

Its design is inspired by ancient Celtic manuscripts, resembling the old-world charm of Ireland's rich history. 

One of my favorite features of this plate is the easel and hook provided for hassle-free hanging. The plate measures a compact 4-inches, making it perfect for small spaces without sacrificing style. However, the writing on the blessing could be clearer, which might be a minor drawback for some.

I recently had the pleasure of using the Kate Spade New York on The Dot Assorted Accent Plates Set of 4 in my daily life, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. The playful polka-dot design was a fun addition to my table settings. 

One of the highlights that stood out to me was the stoneware material. These accent plates were sturdy, yet lightweight. The microwave and dishwasher safe feature made cleanup a breeze, and I didn't have to worry about any chipping or cracking. 

However, there were a few minor drawbacks that I noticed. The plates were not entirely consistent in size, which meant that stacking them together could be slightly unstable.

## Buyer's Guide

Before diving into the world of decorative plates, it is essential to understand what they are and their purpose. Decorative plates are designed to complement and enhance the aesthetic appeal of a room or table setting.

Most decorative plates are dishwasher safe, but it is always best to check the manufacturer's instructions to avoid any damage. For delicate or unique plates, handwashing may be the best option to preserve their appearance and prevent damage. Avoid using abrasive cleaning materials or scrubbers as these can scratch or damage the plate's surface.

Decorative plates can be found in various retail stores, online marketplaces, and directly from the manufacturer. When shopping for decorative plates, consider factors like price, quality, and shipping options.
